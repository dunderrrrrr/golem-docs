# Introduction to Golem Network Guides

Golem aricles are classified as Examples, Tutorials and Guides. Sometime it is difficult to tell the clear border, as the content depends on the author stile.

As with every classification, it should be treated more as a guideline.

## Guides

Guides should introdice concepts and explain terms. The should also intriduce appropiate wording that will be used to name the activities and relations between different entitis.

Guides do not not have to contain exmaples or detailes instructions. Rather then they should contain a high level overview of the process:

- Introduce terms
- Explain them
- Show the process

and refer to examples or tutorials for details.

## Tuorials and examples:

Examples should be possibel to complete in one step. Should focus on specific topic and all not relevant topic should be simplified

Tuorials, on the other hand, can be done in steps. there might be interaction beteen different elements that impact the proposed solution.
The steps can be from different areas: how to organize debugging, how to name the file, how to install a tool, how to define a function in the code.


# Task model

As the normal nody text is montounus and borring (and difficutl to read), make sure that __term__ are visible or even are [link](#task-model) to specific sections or other articles.

## Remember this is guide

So shoud cover the topic broadly, and point to the artcles that explore topics in depth.

You can also provide an overview of interesting areas and point to specific examples or tutorials.
