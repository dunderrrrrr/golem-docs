## Welcome to Golem: Power Your Creations

The Golem Network is place where your innovative ideas transform into reality on a decentralized computing platform. Here, you'll harness the collective power of global computing resources to build, deploy, and manage applications, services or models with unparalleled efficiency and scale.

Whether you're coding in JavaScript, Python, or leveraging no-code solutions, Golem facilitates your access to a vast, decentralized computational network.

## Getting Started with $GLM

To bring your creations to life on the Golem Network, you'll need some $GLM tokens. These tokens are the backbone of our ecosystem, enabling you to utilize and contribute to the computing power shared across the network.

### Why $GLM?

$GLM tokens facilitate transactions within the Golem Network, allowing you to:

- Deploy and Run Applications: Whether you're coding in JS, Python, or deploying without code, $GLM tokens are required to execute your projects on the network.
- Share Computing Power: Earn $GLM by sharing your unused computing resources with those in need of extra computational power.
- Access a Decentralized Marketplace: Engage with a global community where computing power is traded without the need for centralized cloud computing providers.

### How to Acquire $GLM

- **Test Network for Developers**: Specifically designed for new participants in the Golem network and developers experimenting with their projects, this test network introduces "tGLM," a testnet token. tGLM is a simulated version of the Golem token (GLM) used exclusively within the Golem testnet. It's important to note that tGLM holds no real-world value, serving solely for development and testing purposes within the Golem Network.
- **Onboarding Portal**: Visit our [onboarding portal](https://glm.golem.network/) for a guided experience in purchasing $GLM tokens.
- **Cryptocurrency Exchanges**: $GLM is available on several leading exchanges. Here are the links to these platforms:
  - [Binance](https://www.binance.com/)
  - [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)
  - [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)
  - [OKX](https://www.okx.com/)

  - [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/)
  - [HTX](https://www.htx.com/)
  - [Bithumb](https://www.bithumb.com/)
