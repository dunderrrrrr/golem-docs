# JS docs content

Welcome to the docs page for Golem JS SDK. 

The core of JS SDK is the __yajsapi__ library that enables interaction with the Golem Network. You can run JS scripts in Node.js and web browsers. We provide a documentation package to help you quickly understand and use Golem Network and the necessary tools.

There are many ways you can start your journey with Golem and create great decentralized apps you can learn in the way that suits your style and preference:

|         |                                                                                                   |
|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Quickstarts | If you prefer to start with something quick and simple - select one of our [QuickStarts](/docs/creators/javascript/quickstarts/index). They contain instructions that show how to run our apps quickly. |
|Tutorials |If you want to learn how to write apps on Golem on practical use cases - try one of our [tutorials](/docs/creators/javascript/tutorials/index). In the [Running tasks in parallel tutorial](/docs/creators/javascript/tutorials/running-parallel-tasks) you will create an app that recovers passwords using the `hashcat` utility. You will learn how to split the job into multiple smaller tasks and run them in parallel on the Golem Network. You will also create a custom image with the software dedicated to the task and run the app on the network.|
| Guides | If you prefer to begin with understanding the Golem Network concept and have an overview of the Task API model - check out the [Guides](/docs/creators/javascript/guides/index) section. You can also find an explanation of the Golem image and how to create a custom one. |
| JS Examples | If you want to explore Task API features through examples that illustrate how to use our Task API - go directly to [JS Examples](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/index). You will find ready-to-run examples with explanations and comments to help you understand and apply new features to your apps. |
|Tools examples | [Golem tools examples](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/tools/index) contains instructions on how to install and run the `yagna` daemon (this is the piece that makes you part of the Golem Network) and `gvmkit-build` - a tool that allows you to create your custom Golem images - they are important components of Golem apps.|
| API Reference | We provide you with an API reference where you can explore details of the [API](/docs/creators/javascript/docs/index).|
