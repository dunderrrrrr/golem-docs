This code exports various modules from the `yajsapi` project. These modules include `PaymentService`, `Invoice`, `DebitNote`, `Allocation`, `Accounts`, `Payments`, `PaymentEventType`, `InvoiceEvent`, `DebitNoteEvent`, `Rejection`, and `RejectionReason`. 

The `PaymentService` module is likely responsible for handling payment-related functionality within the project. The `Invoice` and `DebitNote` modules may be used for creating and managing invoices and debit notes, respectively. The `Allocation` module may be used for allocating payments to specific accounts or invoices. The `Accounts` module may be used for managing accounts within the project. 

The `Payments` module likely handles payment events and includes various event types such as `PaymentEventType`, `InvoiceEvent`, and `DebitNoteEvent`. The `Rejection` and `RejectionReason` modules may be used for handling payment rejections and associated reasons. 

Overall, this code serves to export various modules that are likely used throughout the `yajsapi` project for payment-related functionality. 

Example usage:

```
import { PaymentService, Invoice } from "yajsapi";

const paymentService = new PaymentService();
const invoice = new Invoice();

// Use paymentService and invoice objects for payment-related functionality
```
