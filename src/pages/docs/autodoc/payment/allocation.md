The `Allocation` module is a mid-level module that represents a designated sum of money reserved for the purpose of making some particular payments. This module is used to create, release, and get information about an allocation. 

The `Allocation` class has several properties, including `id`, `timestamp`, `timeout`, `address`, `paymentPlatform`, `totalAmount`, `spentAmount`, and `remainingAmount`. The `create` method is used to create a new allocation. It takes an `AllocationOptions` object as an argument, which includes an account object with an address and platform, and an optional `expires` field. The `create` method returns a new `Allocation` object.

The `Allocation` class also has several methods, including `getRemainingAmount`, `getSpentAmount`, `release`, and `getDemandDecoration`. The `getRemainingAmount` method returns the remaining amount for the allocation, while the `getSpentAmount` method returns the already spent amount for the allocation. The `release` method is used to release the allocation, and the `getDemandDecoration` method returns the Market ya-ts-client decoration.

The `Allocation` class constructor takes an `AllocationConfig` object and a `Model` object as arguments. The `Model` object is used to initialize the properties of the `Allocation` object. The `refresh` method is used to update the `spentAmount` and `remainingAmount` properties of the `Allocation` object.

Overall, the `Allocation` module is used to manage allocations for making payments. It provides methods for creating, releasing, and getting information about an allocation. The `Allocation` class is initialized with an `AllocationConfig` object and a `Model` object, and it has several properties and methods for managing allocations.
