The `Agreement` class in the `yajsapi` project represents a contract between a requestor and a provider. This class provides methods to create, refresh, confirm, and terminate an agreement. 

The `Agreement` class has a constructor that takes an agreement ID, a provider object, and an options object. The provider object contains the name and ID of the provider. The options object contains various options such as `yagnaOptions`, `agreementRequestTimeout`, `agreementWaitingForApprovalTimeout`, `logger`, and `eventTarget`. 

The `create` method is a static method that creates an agreement for a given proposal ID. It returns a new instance of the `Agreement` class. 

The `refreshDetails` method refreshes the details of the agreement. It retrieves the agreement data from the API and sets the `agreementData` property of the class. 

The `getState` method returns the state of the agreement. It calls the `refreshDetails` method and returns the `state` property of the `agreementData` object. 

The `confirm` method confirms the agreement and waits for the provider to approve it. It calls the `confirmAgreement` method of the API and then waits for the provider to approve the agreement by calling the `waitForApproval` method of the API. If the agreement is approved, it dispatches an `AgreementConfirmed` event. If the agreement is rejected or fails to confirm, it throws an error. 

The `isFinalState` method returns a boolean indicating whether the agreement is in its final state. If the agreement is in its final state, it will not change state further. 

The `terminate` method terminates the agreement. It calls the `terminateAgreement` method of the API and waits for the agreement to be terminated. If the agreement is terminated, it dispatches an `AgreementTerminated` event. If the agreement fails to terminate, it throws an error. 

Overall, the `Agreement` class provides a high-level interface for creating, managing, and terminating agreements between requestors and providers in the `yajsapi` project. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import { Agreement } from "yajsapi";

const agreement = await Agreement.create("proposalId", {
  yagnaOptions: { network: "main" },
  agreementRequestTimeout: 10000,
  agreementWaitingForApprovalTimeout: 10000,
  logger: console,
  eventTarget: window,
});

await agreement.confirm();

const isFinal = await agreement.isFinalState();

await agreement.terminate();
```
## Questions:
