The `AgreementPoolService` class is a service used in the `TaskExecutor` of the yajsapi project. It is responsible for managing the creation, release, and termination of agreements between the provider and the consumer. 

The class has several methods that allow the user to interact with the service. The `run()` method starts the service, while the `end()` method stops it. The `addProposal(proposalId: string)` method adds a new proposal to the pool of proposals. The `getAgreement()` method returns an available agreement from the pool or creates a new one if none are available. The `releaseAgreement(agreementId: string, allowReuse = false)` method releases or terminates an agreement by ID. The `terminateAll(reason?: { [key: string]: string })` method terminates all agreements. The `isProviderLastAgreementRejected(providerId: string): boolean` method returns information about whether the last provider rejected the agreement.

The class also has several private methods that are used internally. The `getAvailableAgreement()` method returns an available agreement from the pool of agreements that can be reused. The `createAgreement()` method creates a new agreement using a proposal from the pool of proposals. The `getAvailableProposal()` method returns an available proposal from the pool of proposals. The `waitForAgreementApproval(agreement: Agreement)` method waits for an agreement to be approved by the provider.

The `AgreementPoolService` class implements the `ComputationHistory` interface, which allows it to store the history of computations. The class also has a logger that can be used to log messages.

Overall, the `AgreementPoolService` class is an important part of the yajsapi project, as it manages the creation, release, and termination of agreements between the provider and the consumer. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage the agreements and proposals, making it easier for the user to interact with the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AgreementPoolService` class?
- The `AgreementPoolService` class is a service used in `TaskExecutor` to manage agreements and proposals.

2. What interfaces are extended by the `AgreementServiceOptions` interface?
- The `AgreementServiceOptions` interface extends the `AgreementOptions` interface and adds additional options for agreement event pooling and waiting for proposal timeout.

3. What is the purpose of the `releaseAgreement` method?
- The `releaseAgreement` method is used to release or terminate an agreement by ID. If `allowReuse` is true, the agreement is returned to the pool for further reuse, otherwise it is terminated and removed from the pool.
