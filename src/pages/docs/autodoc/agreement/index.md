This code exports several modules from different files within the yajsapi project. The modules include `Agreement`, `AgreementOptions`, `AgreementStateEnum`, and `ProviderInfo` from the `agreement.js` file, `AgreementPoolService` from the `service.js` file, `AgreementFactory` from the `factory.js` file, and `AgreementConfig` from the `config.js` file.

The purpose of this code is to make these modules available for use in other parts of the yajsapi project. These modules provide functionality related to creating and managing agreements between providers and consumers in a decentralized network. 

For example, the `Agreement` module defines the structure of an agreement and provides methods for creating and managing agreements. The `AgreementPoolService` module provides a service for managing a pool of agreements. The `AgreementFactory` module provides a factory for creating new agreements. The `AgreementConfig` module provides configuration options for agreements.

By exporting these modules, other parts of the yajsapi project can import and use them as needed. For example, a module responsible for managing provider interactions could import the `Agreement` module to create and manage agreements with consumers. 

Overall, this code plays an important role in the yajsapi project by providing essential functionality for managing agreements in a decentralized network.
