The code defines two classes, `AgreementConfig` and `AgreementServiceConfig`, which are used to configure the `RequestorApi` for the yajsapi project. 

The `AgreementConfig` class takes an `AgreementOptions` object as an argument and sets default values for various properties. It then creates a new `Configuration` object using the `apiKey` and `basePath` properties from the `AgreementOptions` object (or from environment variables if not provided), and creates a new `RequestorApi` object using this configuration. The `AgreementConfig` class also sets the `agreementRequestTimeout`, `agreementWaitingForApprovalTimeout`, `logger`, and `eventTarget` properties based on the `AgreementOptions` object. 

The `AgreementServiceConfig` class extends `AgreementConfig` and adds additional properties specific to the `AgreementServiceOptions` object. These include `agreementEventPoolingInterval`, `agreementEventPoolingMaxEventsPerRequest`, and `agreementWaitingForProposalTimout`. 

These classes are used to configure the `RequestorApi` in other parts of the yajsapi project. For example, in the `agreement.js` file, an instance of `AgreementConfig` is created and passed to the `Agreement` class constructor. This allows the `Agreement` class to use the `RequestorApi` to make requests to the yagna market API. 

Here is an example of how the `AgreementConfig` class might be used:

```
import { AgreementConfig } from "yajsapi";

const config = new AgreementConfig({
  yagnaOptions: {
    apiKey: "my-api-key",
    basePath: "http://my-api-url.com",
  },
  agreementRequestTimeout: 5000,
  agreementWaitingForApprovalTimeout: 30,
});

// Use the config object to make requests to the yagna market API
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AgreementConfig` class?
- The `AgreementConfig` class is responsible for configuring the API client used to interact with the yagna market API, as well as setting various timeout and logging options.

2. What is the difference between `AgreementConfig` and `AgreementServiceConfig`?
- `AgreementServiceConfig` extends `AgreementConfig` and adds additional configuration options specific to the `AgreementService`, such as event pooling intervals and timeouts.

3. What are the default values for the configuration options?
- The default values for the configuration options are defined in the `DEFAULTS` object at the top of the file. They include things like the base path for the API, various timeout values, and event pooling settings.
