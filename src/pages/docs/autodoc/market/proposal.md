The `Proposal` module is a mid-level object that represents an offer in the state of a proposal from the provider. This module is part of the larger yajsapi project. The module imports several classes from the `ya-ts-client` and `ya-market` libraries. 

The `Proposal` class has several properties, including `id`, `issuerId`, `properties`, `constraints`, `timestamp`, `state`, `prevProposalId`, and `_score`. The `id` property is a string that represents the ID of the proposal. The `issuerId` property is a string that represents the ID of the issuer of the proposal. The `properties` property is an object that represents the properties of the proposal. The `constraints` property is a string that represents the constraints of the proposal. The `timestamp` property is a string that represents the timestamp of the proposal. The `state` property is an enum that represents the state of the proposal. The `prevProposalId` property is a string that represents the ID of the previous proposal. The `_score` property is a number that represents the score of the proposal.

The `Proposal` class has several methods, including `isInitial()`, `isDraft()`, `isExpired()`, `isRejected()`, `reject(reason)`, and `respond(chosenPlatform)`. The `isInitial()` method returns a boolean that indicates whether the proposal is in the initial state. The `isDraft()` method returns a boolean that indicates whether the proposal is in the draft state. The `isExpired()` method returns a boolean that indicates whether the proposal is in the expired state. The `isRejected()` method returns a boolean that indicates whether the proposal is in the rejected state. The `reject(reason)` method rejects the proposal with the given reason. The `respond(chosenPlatform)` method responds to the proposal with the chosen platform.

The `Proposal` class constructor takes several parameters, including `subscriptionId`, `api`, `model`, `demandRequest`, and `eventTarget`. The `subscriptionId` parameter is a string that represents the ID of the subscription. The `api` parameter is a `RequestorApi` object. The `model` parameter is a `ProposalModel` object. The `demandRequest` parameter is a `DemandOfferBase` object. The `eventTarget` parameter is an `EventTarget` object.

Here is an example of how to use the `Proposal` class:

```javascript
import { Proposal } from "yajsapi";

const proposal = new Proposal(subscriptionId, api, model, demandRequest, eventTarget);

if (proposal.isInitial()) {
  proposal.reject("no reason");
} else if (proposal.isDraft()) {
  proposal.respond("chosen platform");
}
```

In this example, a new `Proposal` object is created with the given parameters. The `isInitial()` method is called to check if the proposal is in the initial state. If it is, the `reject()` method is called with the reason "no reason". If it is not in the initial state, the `isDraft()` method is called to check if the proposal is in the draft state. If it is, the `respond()` method is called with the chosen platform "chosen platform".
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Proposal` class?
    
    The `Proposal` class represents an offer in the state of a proposal from the provider.

2. Why is the `api` parameter passed explicitly to the `Proposal` constructor?
    
    The `api` parameter is passed explicitly to the `Proposal` constructor because it is required to make API calls to interact with the proposal.

3. What is the purpose of the `respond` method in the `Proposal` class?
    
    The `respond` method is used to respond to a proposal with a chosen platform and make an API call to counter-propose the demand.
