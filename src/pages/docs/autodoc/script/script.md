The `Script` class in the `yajsapi` project is a mid-level abstraction that allows users to create and manage a list of `Command` objects. The `Script` class provides methods to add new commands to the list, execute a set of commands before the script runs, and execute a set of commands after the script runs. Additionally, the `Script` class provides a method to generate an `ExeScriptRequest` object that can be used to execute the script on a remote machine.

The `Script` class has a static `create` method that returns a new instance of the `Script` class. This method takes an optional array of `Command` objects as an argument. If no argument is provided, an empty array is used as the default value. The `constructor` method initializes the `commands` property of the `Script` instance with the provided array of `Command` objects or an empty array if no argument is provided.

The `add` method allows users to add a new `Command` object to the list of commands in the `Script` instance. This method takes a `Command` object as an argument and pushes it onto the `commands` array.

The `before` method executes a set of commands before the script runs. This method iterates over the `commands` array and calls the `before` method of each `Command` object in the array. The `before` method is an asynchronous method that returns a Promise.

The `after` method executes a set of commands after the script runs. This method iterates over the `commands` array and calls the `after` method of each `Command` object in the array. The `after` method is an asynchronous method that returns a Promise.

The `getExeScriptRequest` method generates an `ExeScriptRequest` object that can be used to execute the script on a remote machine. This method checks if the `commands` array is empty and throws an error if it is. Otherwise, it returns an `ExeScriptRequest` object with a `text` property that contains a JSON string representation of the `Command` objects in the `commands` array.

Overall, the `Script` class provides a convenient way for users to create and manage a list of `Command` objects and execute them as a script. Here is an example of how to use the `Script` class:

```
import { Script } from "yajsapi";

const script = Script.create();
script.add(new Deploy("my_contract.wasm"));
script.add(new Start("my_contract"));
await script.before();
// execute script
await script.after();
const exeScriptRequest = script.getExeScriptRequest();
// send exeScriptRequest to remote machine for execution
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Command` class and how is it used in this code?
   - The `Command` class is imported from `./command.js` and is used as a parameter type in several methods of the `Script` class. It is likely that `Command` represents a single executable command that can be run as part of a larger script.
2. What is the `ExeScriptRequest` type and where does it come from?
   - The `ExeScriptRequest` type is imported from `"ya-ts-client/dist/ya-activity/src/models/index.js"`. It is used as the return type of the `getExeScriptRequest` method of the `Script` class and likely represents a request object that can be sent to some external API.
3. What is the purpose of the `before` and `after` methods in the `Script` class?
   - The `before` and `after` methods are asynchronous methods that iterate over the `commands` array and call the `before` and `after` methods of each `Command` object. It is likely that these methods are used to perform some setup or cleanup tasks before and after running the script.
