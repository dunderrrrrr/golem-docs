The `TaskService` class is responsible for managing the execution of tasks in the yajsapi project. It is designed to work with a `TaskQueue` object that holds a queue of tasks to be executed. The `TaskService` class is responsible for taking tasks from the queue and executing them. 

The `TaskService` class has a `run()` method that starts the task execution process. It runs in a loop and checks if the number of active tasks is less than the maximum number of parallel tasks allowed. If the number of active tasks is less than the maximum number of parallel tasks allowed, it gets the next task from the queue and starts executing it. If there are no tasks in the queue, it waits for a specified interval before checking again. 

The `TaskService` class has an `end()` method that stops the task execution process. It stops all the activities associated with the tasks and releases the agreements used by the tasks. 

The `TaskService` class uses the `AgreementPoolService` to get agreements for executing tasks. It also uses the `PaymentService` to accept payments for the agreements used by the tasks. The `NetworkService` is used to add a node to the network for executing the tasks. 

The `TaskService` class uses the `Activity` class to create and manage activities associated with the tasks. It creates an activity for each agreement used by the tasks. The `TaskService` class also uses the `WorkContext` class to provide a context for executing the tasks. 

The `TaskService` class has a `startTask()` method that executes a task. It gets an agreement from the `AgreementPoolService` and creates an activity for the agreement if it does not exist. It then executes the task using the worker function associated with the task. If the execution of the task fails, it retries the task if it is marked for retry. If the task cannot be retried, it is rejected. 

The `TaskService` class uses the `TaskConfig` class to set the configuration options for the task execution process. The `TaskOptions` interface is used to define the options for the `TaskService` class. 

Overall, the `TaskService` class is a critical component of the yajsapi project that manages the execution of tasks. It provides a way to execute tasks in parallel and manage the resources required for executing the tasks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TaskService` class?
- The `TaskService` class is responsible for running and managing tasks in parallel, and it interacts with other services such as the `AgreementPoolService`, `PaymentService`, and `NetworkService`.

2. What are the options that can be passed to the `TaskService` constructor?
- The `TaskService` constructor can receive an object of type `TaskOptions`, which includes properties such as `maxParallelTasks`, `taskRunningInterval`, `activityStateCheckingInterval`, `taskTimeout`, `logger`, and `storageProvider`.

3. What is the purpose of the `startTask` method?
- The `startTask` method is responsible for executing a single task by getting an agreement from the `AgreementPoolService`, creating an `Activity` if necessary, and running the task's `Worker` function with the appropriate context. It also handles errors and retries if necessary, and updates the task's status and the `Activity`'s state accordingly.
