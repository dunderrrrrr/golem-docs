The code defines an interface and a class that are used to manage a queue of tasks. The `QueueableTask` interface defines a method `isQueueable()` that returns a boolean value indicating whether a task can be added to the queue. The `TaskQueue` class is a generic class that takes a type parameter `Task` that extends the `QueueableTask` interface. The class has an array property `itemsStack` that holds the tasks in the queue.

The `TaskQueue` class has four methods: `addToEnd()`, `addToBegin()`, `size`, and `get()`. The `addToEnd()` method adds a task to the end of the queue, while the `addToBegin()` method adds a task to the beginning of the queue. Both methods call a private method `_checkIfTaskIsEligibleForAdd()` to ensure that the task being added is queueable. If the task is not queueable, an error is thrown.

The `size` method returns the number of tasks in the queue, while the `get()` method removes and returns the first task in the queue. If the queue is empty, `undefined` is returned.

This code is likely used in the larger project to manage a queue of tasks that need to be executed in a specific order. The `QueueableTask` interface allows for different types of tasks to be added to the queue, as long as they implement the `isQueueable()` method. The `TaskQueue` class provides methods to add tasks to the queue and retrieve them in the order they were added. 

Example usage:

```typescript
class MyTask implements QueueableTask {
  private _queueable: boolean = false;

  constructor(queueable: boolean) {
    this._queueable = queueable;
  }

  isQueueable(): boolean {
    return this._queueable;
  }
}

const taskQueue = new TaskQueue<MyTask>();
const task1 = new MyTask(true);
const task2 = new MyTask(false);

taskQueue.addToEnd(task1);
taskQueue.addToBegin(task2);

console.log(taskQueue.size); // 2

const firstTask = taskQueue.get();
console.log(firstTask); // MyTask { _queueable: false }
console.log(taskQueue.size); // 1
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `QueueableTask` interface?
- The `QueueableTask` interface is used internally and defines a method `isQueueable()` that returns a boolean value.

2. What is the purpose of the `TaskQueue` class?
- The `TaskQueue` class is used to manage a queue of tasks that implement the `QueueableTask` interface. It provides methods to add tasks to the beginning or end of the queue, get the size of the queue, and retrieve the next task in the queue.

3. What happens if a non-queueable task is added to the queue?
- If a non-queueable task is added to the queue, an error will be thrown with the message "You cannot add a task that is not in the correct state". This is checked by the `_checkIfTaskIsEligibleForAdd()` method, which is called by the `addToEnd()` and `addToBegin()` methods.
