The code defines a class called `TaskConfig` that extends another class called `ActivityConfig`. The purpose of this class is to provide configuration options for tasks in the larger project. 

The `TaskConfig` class has several properties that are set in the constructor based on the `TaskOptions` object passed in as an argument. These properties include `maxParallelTasks`, `taskRunningInterval`, `taskTimeout`, `activityStateCheckingInterval`, `storageProvider`, and `logger`. If any of these properties are not provided in the `TaskOptions` object, the default values defined in the `DEFAULTS` object are used instead. 

The `TaskConfig` class is marked as `@internal`, which means that it is not intended to be used outside of the module it is defined in. This suggests that the `TaskConfig` class is used internally by other modules in the `yajsapi` project to configure tasks. 

Here is an example of how the `TaskConfig` class might be used in the larger project:

```
import { TaskConfig } from "yajsapi";

const taskOptions = {
  maxParallelTasks: 10,
  taskTimeout: 60000,
  logger: myLogger,
};

const taskConfig = new TaskConfig(taskOptions);

// Use the taskConfig object to configure tasks in the project
```

In this example, a `TaskConfig` object is created with custom options for `maxParallelTasks`, `taskTimeout`, and `logger`. These options will be used to configure tasks in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TaskConfig` class?
- The `TaskConfig` class extends `ActivityConfig` and provides default values and options for tasks, including maximum parallel tasks, task running interval, task timeout, and activity state checking interval.

2. What are the default values for the task-related options?
- The default values for the task-related options are defined in the `DEFAULTS` object and are as follows: `maxParallelTasks` is 5, `taskRunningInterval` is 1000, `taskTimeout` is 30000, and `activityStateCheckingInterval` is 1000.

3. What are the optional parameters that can be passed to the `TaskConfig` constructor?
- The `TaskConfig` constructor takes an optional `TaskOptions` object as its parameter, which can include `maxParallelTasks`, `taskRunningInterval`, `taskTimeout`, `activityStateCheckingInterval`, `storageProvider`, and `logger`. If any of these options are not provided, the default values will be used.
