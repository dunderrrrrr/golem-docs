The `Batch` class in the `yajsapi` project provides a way to execute a batch of commands on a remote machine using the `Script` class. The `Batch` class is responsible for creating and managing the `Script` object, which is used to build a list of commands to be executed. The `Batch` class provides methods for adding commands to the script, uploading and downloading files, and executing the script.

The `Batch` class has a static `create` method that takes an `Activity` object, a `StorageProvider` object (optional), and a `Logger` object (optional) as arguments. The `Activity` object represents the remote machine on which the commands will be executed. The `StorageProvider` object is used to upload and download files to and from the remote machine. The `Logger` object is used to log messages during the execution of the batch.

The `Batch` class has a constructor that takes an `Activity` object, a `StorageProvider` object (optional), and a `Logger` object (optional) as arguments. The constructor creates a new `Script` object with an empty list of commands.

The `Batch` class provides several methods for adding commands to the script. The `run` method takes one or two arguments: a command string or an array of command arguments. The `uploadFile` method takes a source file path and a destination file path as arguments. The `uploadJson` method takes a JSON object and a destination file path as arguments. The `downloadFile` method takes a source file path and a destination file path as arguments.

The `Batch` class provides two methods for executing the script. The `end` method executes the script and returns a promise that resolves to an array of `Result` objects. The `endStream` method executes the script and returns a readable stream of `Result` objects. The `Result` object represents the result of executing a command in the script and contains information such as the command's exit code, stdout, and stderr.

Overall, the `Batch` class provides a convenient way to execute a batch of commands on a remote machine using the `Script` class. It abstracts away the details of creating and managing the `Script` object and provides a simple API for adding commands to the script and executing it. Here is an example of how the `Batch` class can be used:

```javascript
import { Batch } from "yajsapi";

const activity = ...; // create an Activity object
const storageProvider = ...; // create a StorageProvider object
const logger = ...; // create a Logger object

const batch = Batch.create(activity, storageProvider, logger);

batch
  .run("echo 'Hello, world!'")
  .uploadFile("local-file.txt", "remote-file.txt")
  .downloadFile("remote-file.txt", "local-file.txt")
  .run(["ls", "-l"])
  .end()
  .then((results) => {
    console.log(results);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Batch` class?
- The `Batch` class is used to create and execute a batch of shell commands and file operations.

2. What is the role of the `runtimeContextChecker` function?
- The `runtimeContextChecker` function is used to check if the code is running in a browser environment and throws an error if it is, since some operations are not supported in the browser.

3. What is the difference between the `end` and `endStream` methods?
- The `end` method executes the batch of operations and returns an array of results, while the `endStream` method returns a readable stream of results and is useful for handling large amounts of data.
