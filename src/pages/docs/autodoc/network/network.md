The `Network` class in the `yajsapi` project is used to create and manage a virtual private network (VPN) between two nodes within the Golem Network. The class provides methods to create a new VPN, add a new node to the network, and remove the network. 

The `Network` class takes in a configuration object of type `NetworkOptions` that contains the following properties:
- `networkOwnerId`: the node ID of the owner of this VPN (the requestor)
- `yagnaOptions`: an object containing options for the Yagna executor
- `networkIp`: the IP address of the network. May contain netmask, e.g. "192.168.0.0/24"
- `networkOwnerIp`: the desired IP address of the requestor node within the newly-created network
- `networkMask`: optional netmask (only if not provided within the `ip` argument)
- `networkGateway`: optional gateway address for the network
- `logger`: optional custom logger module

The `create` method is a static method that creates a new VPN and returns a `Network` object. It takes in a `NetworkOptions` object and returns a promise that resolves to a `Network` object. The method first creates a new `NetworkConfig` object using the `NetworkOptions` object. It then calls the `createNetwork` method of the `NetworkConfig` object to create a new network. If the network is successfully created, the method creates a new `Network` object and adds the owner node to the network. If an error occurs, the method throws an error.

The `Network` class also has a `getNetworkInfo` method that returns an object of type `NetworkInfo` that contains information about the network, including the network ID, IP address, netmask, and a list of nodes in the network.

The `addNode` method is used to add a new node to the network. It takes in a `nodeId` parameter that is the node ID within the Golem network of this VPN node, and an optional `ip` parameter that is the IP address to assign to this node. If an IP address is not provided, the method generates a new IP address for the node. The method then creates a new `NetworkNode` object and adds it to the `nodes` map of the `Network` object. Finally, the method calls the `addNode` method of the `NetworkConfig` object to add the node to the network.

The `remove` method is used to remove the network, terminating any connections it provides. It calls the `removeNetwork` method of the `NetworkConfig` object to remove the network.

The `Network` class also has several private methods that are used to ensure that the IP addresses and node IDs are unique and belong to the network.

Overall, the `Network` class provides a high-level interface for creating and managing a VPN between two nodes within the Golem Network. It abstracts away the details of network creation and management, making it easy for developers to create and manage VPNs within their applications. 

Example usage:
```javascript
import { Network } from 'yajsapi';

const network = await Network.create({
  networkOwnerId: 'owner-node-id',
  networkIp: '192.168.0.0/24',
  networkOwnerIp: '192.168.0.1',
});

const node = await network.addNode('new-node-id');
console.log(network.getNetworkInfo());
await network.remove();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `yajsapi` project and how does this code fit into it?
- `yajsapi` is a project that creates VPNs between requestor and provider nodes within the Golem Network. This code is a module within the project that represents the network and provides methods for creating and managing nodes within it.

2. What are the required and optional parameters for creating a new network?
- The required parameter is `networkOwnerId`, which is the node ID of the owner of the VPN. The optional parameters are `yagnaOptions`, `networkIp`, `networkOwnerIp`, `networkMask`, `networkGateway`, and `logger`.

3. What is the purpose of the `NetworkNode` class and how is it used within the `Network` class?
- The `NetworkNode` class represents a node within the network and is used to create and manage nodes within the `Network` class. It is used in the `addNode` method to create a new node and add it to the `nodes` map. It is also used to provide information about the nodes in the network in the `getNetworkInfo` method.
