The code above defines several classes and constants that are used in the yajsapi project. 

The `DEFAULTS` constant defines default values for several properties that are used in the `PackageConfig` class. These properties include the engine to use, the minimum amount of memory and storage required, and the minimum number of CPU threads and cores required. 

The `PackageFormat` enum defines the different package formats that are supported by the project. Currently, the only supported format is `GVMKIT_SQUASH`. 

The `PackageConfig` class is used to configure a package that can be run on a remote compute resource. It takes an object of `PackageOptions` as a parameter, which contains information about the package, such as the image hash, repository URL, and required resources. The class sets default values for any properties that are not provided in the `PackageOptions` object. 

For example, to create a `PackageConfig` object, you could do the following:

```
import { PackageConfig } from 'yajsapi';

const options = {
  imageHash: 'abcdef123456',
  repoUrl: 'https://github.com/my-repo',
  minMemGib: 1,
  minStorageGib: 10,
  minCpuThreads: 2,
  minCpuCores: 1,
  capabilities: ['gpu'],
};

const packageConfig = new PackageConfig(options);
```

This would create a `PackageConfig` object with the specified options, and any properties not provided would use the default values defined in `DEFAULTS`.

Overall, this code provides a way to configure packages that can be run on remote compute resources, and defines default values for the required resources.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PackageConfig` class?
- The `PackageConfig` class is used to create a configuration object for a package, based on the provided `PackageOptions`.

2. What are the default values for the package configuration options?
- The default values for the package configuration options are defined in the `DEFAULTS` object, which includes values for `engine`, `minMemGib`, `minStorageGib`, `minCpuThreads`, `minCpuCores`, and `capabilities`.

3. What is the `PackageFormat` enum used for?
- The `PackageFormat` enum is used to define the different formats that a package can be in, with `UNKNOWN` and `GVMKIT_SQUASH` being the only options currently defined.
