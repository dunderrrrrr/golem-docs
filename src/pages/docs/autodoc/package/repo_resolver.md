The `RepoResolver` class in the `yajsapi` project is responsible for resolving the URL of an image repository. The class uses the `axios` library to check if a given URL is valid and returns the first valid URL from a list of URLs. If no valid URL is found, the class falls back to a default URL.

The class has two methods: `resolveRepoUrl` and `getRepoUrl`. The `resolveRepoUrl` method resolves the URL of the image repository by calling either `resolveRepoUrlForBrowser` or `resolveRepoUrlForNode` depending on the runtime context. The `resolveRepoUrlForBrowser` method uses the Google DNS service to resolve the SRV record for the default repository URL and returns a list of URLs. The `resolveRepoUrlForNode` method uses the Node.js `dns` module to resolve the SRV record for the default repository URL and returns a list of URLs. The `resolveRepoUrl` method then iterates over the list of URLs and returns the first valid URL by calling the `isRecordValid` method.

The `isRecordValid` method checks if a given URL is valid by sending a `HEAD` request to the URL using `axios`. If the request succeeds, the method returns `true`. If the request fails with a non-server error (e.g., a 404 error), the method returns `true`. If the request fails with a server error (e.g., a 500 error), the method returns `false` and logs a warning message.

The `getRepoUrl` method calls the `resolveRepoUrl` method to get the URL of the image repository and logs a debug message if a valid URL is found. If no valid URL is found, the method logs a warning message and returns the fallback URL.

Overall, the `RepoResolver` class is an important part of the `yajsapi` project as it provides a way to resolve the URL of the image repository, which is necessary for running tasks on the Golem network. Here is an example of how the `RepoResolver` class can be used:

```javascript
import { RepoResolver } from "yajsapi";

const resolver = RepoResolver.create({ logger: console });
const repoUrl = await resolver.getRepoUrl();
console.log(`Using image repository: ${repoUrl}.`);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `RepoResolver` that resolves the URL of an image repository using DNS SRV records.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports `axios` and `Logger` from external modules, and uses the `dns` module in Node.js.

3. What is the fallback URL used in case the image repository URL cannot be resolved?
- The fallback URL is `http://girepo.dev.golem.network:8000`.
