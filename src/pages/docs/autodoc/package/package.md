The `Package` class in the `yajsapi` project is a mid-level module that provides an object for describing the payload required by the requestor. It has a static method `create` that takes an object of type `PackageOptions` and returns an instance of the `Package` class. The `PackageOptions` interface defines the properties that can be passed to the `create` method. These properties include the type of engine required, the minimum required memory, disk storage, CPU threads, CPU cores, and provider capabilities to run the application. The `imageHash` property is required and is used to find the package by its contents hash. The `repoUrl` property is optional and is used to specify the repository URL. The `logger` property is also optional and is used to specify a logger instance.

The `Package` class has a method `getDemandDecoration` that returns a `Promise` of type `MarketDecoration`. This method uses the `DecorationsBuilder` class to build a `MarketDecoration` object that describes the requirements of the package. The `DecorationsBuilder` class is imported from the `../market/builder.js` module. The `MarketDecoration` class is not defined in this file, but it is likely defined in the `../market/decoration.js` module.

The `getDemandDecoration` method first calls the `resolveTaskPackageUrl` method to get the URL of the task package. It then uses the `DecorationsBuilder` class to add properties and constraints to the `MarketDecoration` object. The `addProperty` method is used to add the `golem.srv.comp.task_package` property to the `MarketDecoration` object. The `addProperty` method is also used to add the `golem.srv.comp.vm.package_format` property to the `MarketDecoration` object. The `addConstraint` method is used to add constraints to the `MarketDecoration` object. The constraints include the minimum required memory, disk storage, and CPU threads. The `addConstraint` method is also used to add the engine and provider capabilities constraints.

The `Package` class has two private methods `getRepoUrl` and `resolveTaskPackageUrl`. The `getRepoUrl` method returns the repository URL specified in the `PackageOptions` object or gets the repository URL from the `RepoResolver` class. The `RepoResolver` class is imported from the `./repo_resolver.js` module. The `resolveTaskPackageUrl` method gets the task package URL from the repository using the `axios` library. The `axios` library is imported at the top of the file. If the response status is not 200, an error is thrown.

Overall, the `Package` class provides a mid-level module for describing the payload required by the requestor. It uses the `DecorationsBuilder` class to build a `MarketDecoration` object that describes the requirements of the package. The `Package` class also uses the `RepoResolver` class to get the repository URL and the `axios` library to get the task package URL.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Package` class and how is it used?
- The `Package` class is used to describe the payload required by the requestor and is used to create a demand decoration. It can be instantiated using the static `create` method and its `getDemandDecoration` method returns a `MarketDecoration` object.

2. What are the available options for the `engine` property of the `PackageOptions` interface?
- The `engine` property of the `PackageOptions` interface can be set to one of the following values: `vm`, `emscripten`, `sgx`, `sgx-js`, `sgx-wasm`, or `sgx-wasi`.

3. What happens if the response status from the `resolveTaskPackageUrl` method is not 200?
- If the response status from the `resolveTaskPackageUrl` method is not 200, an error is thrown with the message "Error: {response.status}" and the logger (if provided) logs the message "Unable to resolve task package url: Response {response.status}".
