The `StatsService` class is responsible for collecting and processing statistics related to the yajsapi project. It imports several classes from other files in the project, including `Events`, `Logger`, `Providers`, `Tasks`, `Payments`, `Agreements`, `Invoices`, `Proposals`, `Allocations`, `Activities`, and `Times`. 

The class has a constructor that takes an object with two properties: `eventTarget` and `logger`. `eventTarget` is an instance of `EventTarget`, which is used to listen for events that are emitted by the yajsapi project. `logger` is an optional instance of `Logger`, which is used to log debug messages.

The `StatsService` class has several methods that can be used to retrieve statistics about the project. The `run` method starts the service by adding an event listener to the `eventTarget` object. The `end` method stops the service by removing the event listener. 

The `getAllCostsSummary` method returns an array of objects that summarize the costs of all agreements in the project. Each object contains the agreement ID, provider name, number of finished tasks, total cost, and payment status. 

The `getAllCosts` method returns an object that contains the total cost and total paid amount for all agreements in the project. 

The `getComputationTime` method returns the total computation time for the project. 

The `getStatsTree` method returns an object that contains information about all allocations, providers, proposals, agreements, activities, invoices, and payments in the project. 

The `handleEvents` method is a private method that is called whenever an event is emitted by the yajsapi project. It processes the event and updates the relevant statistics. 

Overall, the `StatsService` class provides a way to collect and analyze statistics about the yajsapi project. It can be used to monitor the progress of the project, identify areas for improvement, and optimize performance.
## Questions:

- The `StatsService` class is responsible for handling events related to computation, tasks, allocations, agreements, proposals, invoices, and payments, and provides methods for retrieving statistics related to these entities.

2. What is the structure of the data returned by the `getAllCostsSummary` method?
- The `getAllCostsSummary` method returns an array of objects, where each object represents an agreement and contains information about the agreement's ID, provider name, number of finished tasks, total cost, and payment status.

3. What events are handled by the `handleEvents` method?
- The `handleEvents` method handles events related to computation, tasks, allocations, agreements, proposals, invoices, and payments, including events for starting and finishing computation, creating and confirming agreements, receiving proposals, invoices, and payments, and starting, redoing, rejecting, and finishing tasks.
