This file defines a set of classes that represent events that can be emitted by the yajsapi API. The events are all subclasses of the `BaseEvent` class, which itself extends the `CustomEvent` class. The `CustomEvent` class is a temporary polyfill that provides a way to create custom events in older versions of Node.js and browsers that do not support the `CustomEvent` API natively.

Each event class represents a specific type of event that can occur during the execution of a computation on the Golem network. For example, the `ComputationStarted` event is emitted when a computation is started, while the `ComputationFinished` event is emitted when a computation is finished. Other events represent specific actions that can occur during the execution of a task, such as `TaskStarted`, `TaskFinished`, and `TaskRejected`.

Each event class takes a generic type parameter that specifies the type of data that is associated with the event. For example, the `ComputationFailed` event takes an object that includes an optional `reason` string that provides additional information about why the computation failed.

These event classes can be used by developers who are building applications that use the yajsapi API to listen for specific events and take action when they occur. For example, an application might listen for the `ComputationFinished` event and then retrieve the results of the computation from the Golem network.

Here is an example of how an application might listen for the `ComputationFinished` event:

```typescript
import { ComputationFinished } from 'yajsapi';

// Listen for the ComputationFinished event
document.addEventListener(ComputationFinished.EventType, (event: ComputationFinished) => {
  // Retrieve the results of the computation and do something with them
  const results = event.detail;
  // ...
});
```

Overall, this file provides a set of classes that define the events that can be emitted by the yajsapi API, which can be used by developers to build applications that interact with the Golem network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `yajsapi` project?
- As a code documentation expert, I cannot determine the purpose of the `yajsapi` project based on the provided code alone. 

2. What is the significance of the `EventType` constant?
- The `EventType` constant is a global event type used to emit all API events and should be used on all listeners that would like to handle events.

3. Why is there a `CustomEvent` class defined in the code?
- The `CustomEvent` class is defined as a temporary polyfill because it is now implemented natively only for nodejs 19 and newest browsers.
