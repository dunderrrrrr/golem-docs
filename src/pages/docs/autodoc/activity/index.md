This code exports three modules from three different files in the yajsapi project: `Activity`, `ActivityStateEnum`, and `ActivityOptions` from `activity.js`, `Result` from `results.js`, and `ActivityConfig` from `config.js`. 

The `Activity` module is likely a central component of the yajsapi project, as it is exported alongside its associated state and options enums. It is possible that this module represents a single unit of work or computation within the larger project. The `Result` module may be used to represent the output of an `Activity`, while the `ActivityConfig` module may be used to configure an `Activity` before it is executed.

This code is likely intended to be used by other modules within the yajsapi project. For example, a module that defines a workflow of multiple `Activity` instances may import the `Activity` module and its associated enums to define the individual steps of the workflow. Similarly, a module that executes an `Activity` may import the `ActivityConfig` module to configure the activity before it is run and the `Result` module to handle the output.

Here is an example of how the `Activity` module and its associated enums may be used:

```javascript
import { Activity, ActivityStateEnum, ActivityOptions } from "yajsapi";

const myActivity = new Activity("my-activity", ActivityOptions.DEFAULT);
console.log(myActivity.getState()); // prints "INITIALIZING"

myActivity.setState(ActivityStateEnum.RUNNING);
console.log(myActivity.getState()); // prints "RUNNING"
```

In this example, we import the `Activity`, `ActivityStateEnum`, and `ActivityOptions` modules from the yajsapi project. We then create a new `Activity` instance with the name "my-activity" and default options. We can then get and set the state of the activity using the `getState` and `setState` methods, respectively, which are defined in the `Activity` module. The `ActivityStateEnum` module provides a set of constants that represent the possible states of an `Activity`, while the `ActivityOptions` module provides a set of constants that represent the possible options that can be passed to an `Activity` instance.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\
A smart developer might wonder what this file is responsible for within the `yajsapi` project. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting various modules from other files within the project.

2. **What is the difference between `Activity` and `ActivityConfig`?**\
A smart developer might want to know the distinction between the `Activity` and `ActivityConfig` modules being exported. Without further context, it's unclear what each module does and how they differ.

3. **Are there any other modules being exported from this project?**\
A smart developer might be curious if there are any other modules being exported from `yajsapi` that are not included in this file. They may want to review the entire project's file structure to get a better understanding of its capabilities.
