The `TaskExecutor` class in this code is a high-level module for defining and executing tasks in the Golem network. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of tasks, including creating, initializing, running, and ending tasks. It also provides methods for handling task execution errors and managing task execution statistics.

The `TaskExecutor` class uses various services to manage tasks, such as `MarketService`, `AgreementPoolService`, `TaskService`, `PaymentService`, `NetworkService`, and `StatsService`. These services are responsible for handling different aspects of task execution, such as negotiating agreements with providers, managing task queues, handling payments, and collecting execution statistics.

The `TaskExecutor` class provides several methods for executing tasks:

- `create(options: ExecutorOptionsMixin)`: A factory method that creates and initializes an instance of the `TaskExecutor`.
- `beforeEach(worker: Worker)`: Define a worker function that will be run before each computation task within the same activity.
- `run(worker: Worker)`: Execute a single worker function on the Golem network with a single provider.
- `map(data: Iterable, worker: Worker)`: Map iterable data to a worker function and return computed task results as an AsyncIterable.
- `forEach(data: Iterable, worker: Worker)`: Iterate over given data and execute tasks using the worker function.

The `TaskExecutor` class also provides methods for handling errors and managing task execution statistics:

- `handleCriticalError(e: Error)`: Handle critical errors during task execution, such as stopping the executor and dispatching a `ComputationFailed` event.
- `printStats()`: Print task execution statistics, such as total cost, total paid, and computation time.

Here's an example of how to use the `TaskExecutor` class:

```javascript
const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
  subnetTag: "public",
  payment: { driver: "erc-20", network: "rinkeby" },
  package: "9a3b5d67b0b27746283cb5f287c13eab1beaa12d92a9f536b747c7ae",
});

executor.beforeEach(async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.uploadFile("./params.txt", "/params.txt");
});

await executor.forEach([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], async (ctx, item) => {
  await ctx
    .beginBatch()
    .run(`/run_some_command.sh --input ${item} --params /input_params.txt --output /output.txt`)
    .downloadFile("/output.txt", "./output.txt")
    .end();
});
```

This example demonstrates how to create a `TaskExecutor`, define a worker function to run before each task, and execute tasks using the `forEach` method.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `TaskExecutor` class?**

   The `TaskExecutor` class is a high-level module for defining and executing tasks in the Golem network. It provides methods for creating and initializing an instance of the TaskExecutor, running tasks, mapping iterable data to worker functions, and iterating over given data to execute tasks using worker functions.

2. **How can I create a new instance of the `TaskExecutor` class?**

   To create a new instance of the `TaskExecutor` class, you should use the `TaskExecutor.create()` static method, passing in the appropriate initial parameters such as package, budget, subnet tag, payment driver, payment network, etc.

3. **What are the different methods available in the `TaskExecutor` class and what do they do?**

   The `TaskExecutor` class provides several methods for managing and executing tasks:

   - `init()`: Initializes all executor services.
   - `end()`: Stops all executor services and shuts down the executor instance.
   - `getStats()`: Returns statistics of the execution process.
   - `beforeEach(worker)`: Defines a worker function that will run before each computation task within the same activity.
   - `run(worker)`: Executes a single worker function on the Golem network with a single provider.
   - `map(data, worker)`: Maps iterable data to a worker function and returns computed task results as an AsyncIterable.
   - `forEach(data, worker)`: Iterates over given data and executes tasks using a worker function.
