This code defines a set of utility functions and constants that are used to determine the runtime environment in which the code is executing. Specifically, it checks whether the code is running in a browser, in a Node.js environment, or in a web worker.

The `isBrowser` constant is set to `true` if the `window` object is defined and has a `document` property. This indicates that the code is running in a browser environment.

The `isNode` constant is set to `true` if the `process` object is defined and has a `versions` property that is not null, and that property has a `node` property that is also not null. This indicates that the code is running in a Node.js environment.

The `isWebWorker` constant is set to `true` if the `self` object is defined and has a `constructor` property that is not null, and that property has a `name` property that is set to `"DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope"`. This indicates that the code is running in a web worker environment.

Finally, the `checkAndThrowUnsupportedInBrowserError` function takes a `feature` parameter and throws an error if the `isBrowser` constant is `true`. This is used to prevent certain features from being used in a browser environment where they may not be supported.

Overall, these utilities are used throughout the larger project to ensure that the code behaves correctly in different runtime environments. For example, if a feature is not supported in a browser environment, the `checkAndThrowUnsupportedInBrowserError` function can be used to prevent the feature from being used and to provide a helpful error message to the user.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `isBrowser`, `isNode`, and `isWebWorker` constants?
- These constants are used to determine the environment in which the code is running, specifically whether it is running in a browser, Node.js, or a web worker.

2. What is the purpose of the `checkAndThrowUnsupportedInBrowserError` function?
- This function is used to throw an error if a certain feature is not supported in a browser environment.

3. What is the significance of the `@ignore` JSDoc tag?
- The `@ignore` tag is used to indicate that the following code should be ignored by the documentation generator, as it is not relevant to the public API of the module.
