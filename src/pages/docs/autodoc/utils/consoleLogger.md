The code above defines a class called `ConsoleLogger` that implements the `Logger` interface. This class is a helper class that provides a simple way to log messages to the console. The `Logger` interface defines a set of methods that can be used to log messages at different levels of severity, such as `debug`, `error`, `info`, `log`, and `warn`.

The `ConsoleLogger` class has a property called `level` that is set to `"debug"` by default. This property determines the minimum level of severity that will be logged. For example, if the `level` is set to `"warn"`, only messages with a severity of `"warn"` or higher will be logged.

The class has methods for each level of severity, such as `debug`, `error`, `info`, `log`, and `warn`. Each of these methods calls a private method called `print` that formats the message and logs it to the console using the appropriate severity level.

The class also has a method called `setLevel` that can be used to change the minimum severity level that will be logged. For example, if you want to log only messages with a severity of `"error"` or higher, you can call `setLevel("error")`.

Finally, the class has a method called `table` that can be used to log an object as a table to the console using `console.table`.

This class can be used in the larger project to provide a simple way to log messages to the console. Developers can create an instance of the `ConsoleLogger` class and use its methods to log messages at different levels of severity. For example:

```
import { ConsoleLogger } from './consoleLogger.js';

const logger = new ConsoleLogger();
logger.debug('Debug message');
logger.error('Error message');
logger.info('Info message');
logger.log('Log message');
logger.warn('Warning message');
logger.table({ foo: 'bar', baz: 'qux' });
```

This code creates an instance of the `ConsoleLogger` class and logs messages at different levels of severity using its methods. The `table` method is also used to log an object as a table to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Logger` import statement at the top of the file?
- The `Logger` import statement is used to import a module from the `logger.js` file.

2. What is the significance of the `level` property being set to "debug" in the `ConsoleLogger` class?
- The `level` property being set to "debug" in the `ConsoleLogger` class indicates that the logger will print messages with a severity level of "debug" or higher.

3. What is the purpose of the `table` method in the `ConsoleLogger` class?
- The `table` method in the `ConsoleLogger` class is used to print a formatted table of data to the console.
