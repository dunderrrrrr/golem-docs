This code defines a logger object that uses the Pino logging library to log messages at different levels of severity. The logger object is exported as a constant called `pinoLogger` and is of type `Logger`. The `Logger` type is defined in another file in the same directory as this file.

The `pino` function is imported from the Pino library and is used to create a new logger instance. The logger instance is configured to use the `pino-pretty` transport, which formats the log messages in a human-readable way. The `colorize` option is set to `true`, which adds color to the log messages. The `ignore` option is set to exclude the `pid` and `hostname` fields from the log messages.

The `logLevel` variable is declared but not initialized. It is used to store the current log level of the logger. The log level determines which log messages are actually logged. For example, if the log level is set to `warn`, only log messages with a severity of `warn`, `error`, or `fatal` will be logged.

The `pinoLogger` object has several methods that correspond to different log levels: `debug`, `info`, `log`, `warn`, and `error`. Each method takes a message string as an argument and logs it at the corresponding log level. The `table` method logs an object as a table to the console.

The `setLevel` method takes a string argument and sets the log level of the logger to the corresponding level. For example, calling `pinoLogger.setLevel('warn')` would set the log level to `warn`.

This logger object can be used throughout the larger project to log messages at different levels of severity. Developers can use the `pinoLogger` object to log messages and configure the log level as needed. The `pino-pretty` transport makes it easy to read and understand the log messages, which can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `pino` and `Logger` imports?
- The `pino` import is used to create a logger instance with specific options, while the `Logger` import is used to define the type of the `pinoLogger` object.
2. What is the initial value of the `logLevel` variable?
- The initial value of `logLevel` is `undefined`.
3. What is the purpose of the `setLevel` method in the `pinoLogger` object?
- The `setLevel` method is used to set the logging level of the `logger` instance to the specified level.
