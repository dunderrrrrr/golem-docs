## Who is a Creator?

Creator is someone who has a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware to acomplish his application goal.
Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market called Golem Network.

In golem terminology, a person who requests resources from the network is called a **Requestor**, whereas the
person who shares his resources on the network is called a **Provider**.

You can see the overall structure of the communication on the diagram below

## Why should Creators use SDK?

The Golem SDK allows developers to access resources on the Golem Network. 

We have created different tools and APIs that are suited for different needs:

- [dApps](dapps/index.md) allow for a YAML-based deployment, that aims to ease the process for Docker-based dApps

[Try dApps!](dapps/index.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

- [JS API](javascript/index.md) allows for scheduling distributed tasks on Golem network, usable from the browser, that aims to provide a good control and easy interfaces to interact with the Golem Network

[Try JS API!](javascript/index.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

If you'd like to see Python API features, please visit the [official docs](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development)
